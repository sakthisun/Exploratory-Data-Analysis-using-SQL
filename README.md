Exploratory Data Analysis using SQL

I came across a fictional sales dataset on Kaggle that contains three tables: sales, product, and customer details. The actual dataset is uploaded in the same repository as this project, and a link to the dataset is also provided.

Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/4fc4197e6f85cc6cbece21e4e524f0bfa3036be72a2958f2af53428ebb54aca7

I performed exploratory data analysis on this sales data using MySQL and gathered several insights about the dataset.

Sales Analysis


Total orders of the company
Total revenue of the company
Revenue distribution by year
Revenue distribution by month
Revenue distribution by quarter
Maximum order value


Product Analysis


Top 5 selling products by revenue
Total number of products available
Top 5 expensive products


Customer Analysis


Total number of customers
Total customers by age group



These are the questions I tried to answer from the dataset. In this analysis, I used Common Table Expressions (CTEs), subqueries, and performed joins on these tables.
